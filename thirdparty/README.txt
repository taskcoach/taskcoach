# Third-Party Libraries

**NOTE**: This folder is legacy and no longer contains third-party libraries.

The third-party libraries bundled with Task Coach are located in:
  `taskcoachlib/thirdparty/`

The libraries originally documented here (aui, customtreectrl, hypertreelist, desktop, etc.)
have been removed or refactored as part of the Python 3 migration. See:
  `docs/PYTHON3_MIGRATION_NOTES.md` - Section "Bundled Third-Party Library Cleanup"

For the current list of bundled libraries, see:
  `taskcoachlib/thirdparty/README.txt`
