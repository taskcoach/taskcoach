Description: Personal task manager with support for composite tasks
 Task Coach is a free open source todo manager. It grew out of frustration
 about other programs not handling composite tasks well. In addition to
 flexible composite tasks, Task Coach has grown to include prerequisites,
 prioritizing, effort tracking, category tags, budgets, notes, and many
 other features.
 .
 However, users are not forced to use all these features; Task Coach can
 be as simple or complex as you need it to be.
 .
 Features include:
  * Composite tasks (tasks with subtasks)
  * Task prerequisites
  * Effort tracking and time registration
  * Categories and tags
  * Budget tracking
  * Notes attachment
  * Multiple views (tree, list, calendar)
  * Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
 .
 Optional features:
  * python3-zeroconf: iPhone sync service discovery
  * python3-squaremap: Hierarchical data visualization
  * python3-gntp: Growl notification support (not available in Bookworm)
