# git-buildpackage configuration for Task Coach
#
# This debian/ directory is provided by upstream for local convenience builds.
# Per DEP-14: "Users who have cloned the repository should be able to run
# dpkg-buildpackage -b -us -uc without doing anything else"
#
# This is NOT intended for official Debian archive submission.
# Official Debian packaging should use separate branches per DEP-14:
#   upstream/latest - release tarball contents (no debian/)
#   debian/latest   - official Debian packaging
#
# See: https://dep-team.pages.debian.net/deps/dep14/
#      https://wiki.debian.org/PackagingWithGit

[DEFAULT]
# This is an upstream repo, not a Debian packaging repo
# No pristine-tar needed (we are upstream, no tarballs to track)
pristine-tar = False

# Upstream tags use v prefix (e.g., v1.6.1)
upstream-tag = v%(version)s

[buildpackage]
# Binary-only builds are sufficient for local testing
# Source packages require manual orig tarball creation (see PACKAGING.md)
export-dir = ../build-area/

[dch]
# Use git commit messages for changelog entries
