# Patches for Task Coach Debian package
#
# Note: The wxPython hypertreelist patch (PR #2088) is NOT applied via quilt.
# Instead, the pre-patched file is bundled at patches/wxpython/hypertreelist.py
# and installed to /usr/share/taskcoach/lib/ by debian/rules.
#
# This is because the file being patched (wx/lib/agw/hypertreelist.py) belongs
# to the python3-wxgtk4.0 package, not Task Coach. We bundle a patched copy
# rather than modifying the system wxPython installation.
#
# The patch can be removed when Debian ships wxPython >= 4.2.4.
