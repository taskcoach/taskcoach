Upstream debian/ Directory for Local Builds
============================================

This debian/ directory is provided by upstream for local testing and builds.
It is NOT intended for official Debian archive submission.

Purpose
-------
- Local .deb builds for testing
- Development convenience
- Not included in release tarballs (via .gitattributes export-ignore)

Official Debian Packaging
-------------------------
Official Debian packaging should be maintained separately in debian/* branches
following the standard Debian workflow:

- upstream/master: Contains release tarball contents (no debian/)
- debian/master: Derived from upstream/master, contains official debian/

This separation allows Debian maintainers to properly track upstream releases
and maintain patches independently using quilt and gbp-pq tooling.

This upstream debian/ directory is based on former Debian packaging work
and is provided as a convenience for contributors who want to build and
test .deb packages locally.
